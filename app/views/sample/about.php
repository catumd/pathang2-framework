<h1> hi folks !</h1>
<p> im krishna Teja, im a physics teacher by profession and a programmer by interest. </p>
<p> i surf a lot and learn through internet, usually i start a project  with 100% dedication and interest but as the code grows it leaves me in frustration
 and reasons are im not a good programmer, i never structure the code and tracking down bugs is always a nightmare to me. I thought of picking up a good framework but im quite lazy, i never
 hold interest in reading through vast docs of powerful frameworks, i hate the conventions they use, so i decided to write a very simple framework to develop web apps
 with ease and finally im thru. This is dedicated to all lazy nerds like me</p>
